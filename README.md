# ASTR_3730_Recitation
Course files/labs for ASTR 3730.

Download these by clicking the big green button, or for those who are command line savvy (or aspire to be command line savvy) you can do something like:

`git clone https://github.com/kirklong/ASTR_3730_Recitation.git`

However you do it, make sure you download all the files and that you preserve the directory structure wherever you put them. 

If you plan to do this in Python, make sure you open the Python notebook (ignore the Julia one). You will need the random, matplotlib, numpy, pandas, csv, and scipy packages. I believe those will probably be installed by default if you go the Anaconda route, but if for some reason you're missing any of them I can show you how to install them. If you want to be exceptionally brave and try Julia then you will use the Julia one, but you need to complete the following extra steps:

1. Download and install [Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/)

2. Follow these [instructions to make Julia work with Jupyter](https://datatofish.com/add-julia-to-jupyter/)

3. Install the DataFrames, Plots, Random, CSV, and FFTW packages. I think everything but (maybe?) FFTW should come pre-installed automatically, but you can add any if they're missing quickly/easily from a Julia session.
